# Rancid

## What is Rancid?

[Rancid]() is combination of a few things: a widget library, a number of scripts and programs, and a 
framework for writing reusable eww widgets in yuck. Over time, we hope that rancid will also become
a community project where other eww users write and contribute new widgets and styles.

The goal of rancid is to be an extremely simple, yet complete and extensible way for people to 
begin using eww without having to learn yuck or css to write your own widgets, scripts, or styles.

Rancid allows users to get a fully featured bar running very quickly by simply editing a few config 
variables and selecting which widgets to use.

For more advanced users, the ability to write custom widgets, override builtin widgets, and use 
other's widgets is fully retained.

## Widget library

Rancid comes with an ever-increasing number of premade widgets that are ready for immediate use.
The following section of the documentation contains a page for each available premade widget, or 
take a look at some of the [most commonly used]() widgets.

Widgets are built in a way that different backends can be used with the same widget.

The ability to create custom widgets or import other's widgets as plugins is also present.

## Themes and styles

Rancid comes with a number of pre-configured color schemes to use, including many of the most 
popular such as tokyonight, gruvbox, and nord. 
See the [themes]() page for a complete list.

In addition, rancid allows users to configure the shapes of widgets independently of the color 
scheme used.

When needed, users can also override any predefined style.
