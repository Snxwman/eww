# Widgets

## Variables



## Interaction

No commands as raw strings should be written directly in a widget. Only call scripts and pass arguments as yuck strings.

Any commands run by one of the following attributes, or as part of a `defpoll` or `deflisten` variable, should be extracted to a script.

`:onhover`

`:onhoverlost`

`:onclick`

`:onmiddleclick`

`:onrightclick`

`:onchange`

`:onaccept`

`:onchecked`

`:onunchecked`

`:onscroll`

`:ondropped`
